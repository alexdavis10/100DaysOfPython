# My Python Journey
This is my github repo for learning python. I will be working on replit website and then posting here each day of what I learn.


### Day 1 / 100
```
# Day 1/100 - Strings and Printing Output
# Using 3 double quotes can be used to print a lot of words in exactly the format you want rather than printing all on one line.

I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minium of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amzing onine IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No execuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling ðŸ˜Ž

### Day 2 / 100
```
# Day 2 - Learning variables and input request
# You can print variables by using either methods below

print("Hello, and welcome!")
print()
userName = input("What is your name? ")
userFood = input("What is your favorite food? ")
userMusic = input("What is your favorite type of music genre? ")
userHome = input("What state are you from? ")
print("Thank you for your input!")
print()
print(f"So you are {userName}, your favorite food is {userFood}, your favorite music genre is {userMusic}, and you live in the great state of {userHome}. That's really cool! ")
```
